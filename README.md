Sure, here is a README file for a minimal Flask app that you can add to your GitHub repository:

# Minimal Flask App

## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a minimal Flask application. Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It's designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind, making it an excellent choice for small to medium-sized applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KitimboRino/python-flask-minimal-app.git
   cd python-flask-minimal-app
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   It's good practice to create a virtual environment to manage your dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install Flask using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Run the Flask App**:
   Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

## File Structure

```
minimal-flask-app/
├── hello.py
├── requirements.txt
├── .flaskenv
└── README.md
```

- `hello.py`: The main application file.
- `.flaskenv`: The app configurations.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the dependencies (Flask in this case).
- `README.md`: This file.

## Code Explanation

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

- **Import Flask**: Imports the Flask class.
- **Create Flask App**: Creates an instance of the Flask class.
- **Define Route**: Defines a route for the root URL (`/`) and binds it to the render_template function, which returns index.html page.
- **Run App**: Starts the Flask development server if the script is run directly.

## Conclusion

You have successfully set up and run a minimal Flask application. This basic setup can be expanded with additional routes, templates, and other functionalities as you develop your application further.
